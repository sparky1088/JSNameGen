# JSNameGen
A few javascript functions and arrays for generating names, based on various wikipedia articles.

Egytian Names was taken from donjon.bin.sh
The rest are from the PHB or Wikipedia. 

I've include some of the original files as it was a process and changed what I originally intended to do with what I am currently doing.

NameGen.js comes from a reddit user /u/boltorian as well as the DM Screen from wizards of the coast. I decided to keep both his/her double letter form and wotc single letter form (eg far and farr) as I felt it adds variation to names that occurs naturally in the real world.
